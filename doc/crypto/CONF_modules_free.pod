=head1 NAME

CONF_modules_free, CONF_modules_finish, CONF_modules_unload -
OpenSSL configuration cleanup functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/conf.h>

 void CONF_modules_finish(void);
 void CONF_modules_unload(int all);

Deprecated:

 #if OPENSSL_API_COMPAT < 0x10100000L
 void CONF_modules_free(void)
 #endif

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CONF_modules_free() closes down and frees up all memory allocated by all
configuration modules.

CONF_modules_finish() calls each configuration modules B<finish> handler
to free up any configuration that module may have performed.

CONF_modules_unload() finishes and unloads configuration modules. If
B<all> is set to B<0> only modules loaded from DSOs will be unloads. If
B<all> is B<1> all modules, including builtin modules will be unloaded.

=head1 NOTES

Normally in versions of OpenSSL prior to 1.1.0 applications will only call
CONF_modules_free() at application exit to tidy up any configuration performed.
From 1.1.0 CONF_modules_free() is deprecated and no explicit CONF cleanup is
required at all. For more information see L<OPENSSL_init_crypto(3)>.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

None of the functions return a value.
