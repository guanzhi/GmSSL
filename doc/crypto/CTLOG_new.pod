=head1 NAME

CTLOG_new, CTLOG_new_from_base64, CTLOG_free,
CTLOG_get0_name, CTLOG_get0_log_id, CTLOG_get0_public_key -
encapsulates information about a Certificate Transparency log

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ct.h>

 CTLOG *CTLOG_new(EVP_PKEY *public_key, const char *name);
 int CTLOG_new_from_base64(CTLOG ** ct_log,
                           const char *pkey_base64, const char *name);
 void CTLOG_free(CTLOG *log);
 const char *CTLOG_get0_name(const CTLOG *log);
 void CTLOG_get0_log_id(const CTLOG *log, const uint8_t **log_id,
                        size_t *log_id_len);
 EVP_PKEY *CTLOG_get0_public_key(const CTLOG *log);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CTLOG_new() returns a new CTLOG that represents the Certificate Transparency
(CT) log with the given public key. A name must also be provided that can be
used to help users identify this log. Ownership of the public key is
transferred.

CTLOG_new_from_base64() also creates a new CTLOG, but takes the public key in
base64-encoded DER form and sets the ct_log pointer to point to the new CTLOG.
The base64 will be decoded and the public key parsed.

Regardless of whether CTLOG_new() or CTLOG_new_from_base64() is used, it is the
caller's responsibility to pass the CTLOG to CTLOG_free() once it is no longer
needed. This will delete it and, if created by CTLOG_new(), the EVP_PKEY that
was passed to it.

CTLOG_get0_name() returns the name of the log, as provided when the CTLOG was
created. Ownership of the string remains with the CTLOG.

CTLOG_get0_log_id() sets *log_id to point to a string containing that log's
LogID (see RFC 6962). It sets *log_id_len to the length of that LogID. For a
v1 CT log, the LogID will be a SHA-256 hash (i.e. 32 bytes long). Ownership of
the string remains with the CTLOG.

CTLOG_get0_public_key() returns the public key of the CT log. Ownership of the
EVP_PKEY remains with the CTLOG.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

CTLOG_new() will return NULL if an error occurs.

CTLOG_new_from_base64() will return 1 on success, 0 otherwise.
