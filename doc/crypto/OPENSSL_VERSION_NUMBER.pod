=head1 NAME

OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER, OpenSSL_version,
OpenSSL_version_num - get OpenSSL version number

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/opensslv.h>
 #define OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER 0xnnnnnnnnnL

 #include <openssl/crypto.h>

 unsigned long OpenSSL_version_num();
 const char *OpenSSL_version(int t);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER is a numeric release version identifier:

 MNNFFPPS: major minor fix patch status

The status nibble has one of the values 0 for development, 1 to e for betas
1 to 14, and f for release.

for example

 0x000906000 == 0.9.6 dev
 0x000906023 == 0.9.6b beta 3
 0x00090605f == 0.9.6e release

Versions prior to 0.9.3 have identifiers E<lt> 0x0930.
Versions between 0.9.3 and 0.9.5 had a version identifier with this
interpretation:

 MMNNFFRBB major minor fix final beta/patch

for example

 0x000904100 == 0.9.4 release
 0x000905000 == 0.9.5 dev

Version 0.9.5a had an interim interpretation that is like the current one,
except the patch level got the highest bit set, to keep continuity.  The
number was therefore 0x0090581f.

OpenSSL_version_num() returns the version number.

OpenSSL_version() returns different strings depending on B<t>:

=over 4

=item OPENSSL_VERSION

The text variant of the version number and the release date.  For example,
"OpenSSL 1.0.1a 15 Oct 2015".

=item OPENSSL_CFLAGS

The compiler flags set for the compilation process in the form
"compiler: ..."  if available or "compiler: information not available"
otherwise.

=item OPENSSL_BUILT_ON

The date of the build process in the form "built on: ..." if available
or "built on: date not available" otherwise.

=item OPENSSL_PLATFORM

The "Configure" target of the library build in the form "platform: ..."
if available or "platform: information not available" otherwise.

=item OPENSSL_DIR

The "OPENSSLDIR" setting of the library build in the form "OPENSSLDIR: "...""
if available or "OPENSSLDIR: N/A" otherwise.

=item OPENSSL_ENGINES_DIR

The "ENGINESDIR" setting of the library build in the form "ENGINESDIR: "...""
if available or "ENGINESDIR: N/A" otherwise.

=back

For an unknown B<t>, the text "not available" is returned.
