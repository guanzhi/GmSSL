=head1 NAME

DH_new, DH_free - allocate and free DH objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/dh.h>

 DH* DH_new(void);

 void DH_free(DH *dh);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DH_new() allocates and initializes a B<DH> structure.

DH_free() frees the B<DH> structure and its components. The values are
erased before the memory is returned to the system.
If B<dh> is NULL nothing is done.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, DH_new() returns B<NULL> and sets an error
code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>. Otherwise it returns
a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

DH_free() returns no value.
