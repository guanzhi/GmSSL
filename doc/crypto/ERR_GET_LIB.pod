=head1 NAME

ERR_GET_LIB, ERR_GET_FUNC, ERR_GET_REASON, ERR_FATAL_ERROR
- get information from error codes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/err.h>

 int ERR_GET_LIB(unsigned long e);

 int ERR_GET_FUNC(unsigned long e);

 int ERR_GET_REASON(unsigned long e);

 int ERR_FATAL_ERROR(unsigned long e);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The error code returned by ERR_get_error() consists of a library
number, function code and reason code. ERR_GET_LIB(), ERR_GET_FUNC()
and ERR_GET_REASON() can be used to extract these.

ERR_FATAL_ERROR() indicates whether a given error code is a fatal error.

The library number and function code describe where the error
occurred, the reason code is the information about what went wrong.

Each sub-library of OpenSSL has a unique library number; function and
reason codes are unique within each sub-library.  Note that different
libraries may use the same value to signal different functions and
reasons.

B<ERR_R_...> reason codes such as B<ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE> are globally
unique. However, when checking for sub-library specific reason codes,
be sure to also compare the library number.

ERR_GET_LIB(), ERR_GET_FUNC(), ERR_GET_REASON(), and ERR_FATAL_ERROR()
 are macros.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The library number, function code, reason code, and whether the error
is fatal, respectively.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head1 HISTORY

ERR_GET_LIB(), ERR_GET_FUNC() and ERR_GET_REASON() are available in
all versions of OpenSSL.
