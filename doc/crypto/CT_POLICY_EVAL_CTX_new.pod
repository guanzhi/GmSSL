=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ct.h>

 CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_new(void);
 void CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_free(CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *ctx);
 X509* CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_get0_cert(const CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *ctx);
 int CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_set1_cert(CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *ctx, X509 *cert);
 X509* CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_get0_issuer(const CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *ctx);
 int CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_set1_issuer(CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *ctx, X509 *issuer);
 const CTLOG_STORE *CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_get0_log_store(const CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *ctx);
 void CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_set_shared_CTLOG_STORE(CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX *ctx, CTLOG_STORE *log_store);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A B<CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX> is used by functions that evaluate whether Signed
Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) fulfil a Certificate Transparency (CT) policy.
This policy may be, for example, that at least one valid SCT is available. To
determine this, an SCT's signature must be verified. This requires:

=over

=item * the public key of the log that issued the SCT

=item * the certificate that the SCT was issued for

=item * the issuer certificate (if the SCT was issued for a pre-certificate)

=back

The above requirements are met using the setters described below.

CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_new() creates an empty policy evaluation context. This
should then be populated using:

=over

=item * CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_set1_cert() to provide the certificate the SCTs were issued for

Increments the reference count of the certificate.

=item * CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_set1_issuer() to provide the issuer certificate

Increments the reference count of the certificate.

=item * CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_set_shared_CTLOG_STORE() to provide a list of logs that are trusted as sources of SCTs

Holds a pointer to the CTLOG_STORE, so the CTLOG_STORE must outlive the
CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX.

=back

Each setter has a matching getter for accessing the current value.

When no longer required, the B<CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX> should be passed to
CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_free() to delete it.

=head1 NOTES

The issuer certificate only needs to be provided if at least one of the SCTs
was issued for a pre-certificate. This will be the case for SCTs embedded in a
certificate (i.e. those in an X.509 extension), but may not be the case for SCTs
found in the TLS SCT extension or OCSP response.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

CT_POLICY_EVAL_CTX_new() will return NULL if malloc fails.
