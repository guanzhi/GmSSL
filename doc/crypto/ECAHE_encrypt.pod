=head1 DESCRIPTION

Applications should use the higher level functions
L<EVP_DigestInit(3)> etc. instead of calling the hash
functions directly.

SM3 (ShangMi#3 Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographic hash function with a
256 bit output.

sm3() computes the SM3 message digest of the B<n>
bytes at B<d> and places it in B<md> (which must have space for
SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH == 20 bytes of output). If B<md> is NULL, the digest
is placed in a static array. Note: setting B<md> to NULL is B<not thread safe>.

The following functions may be used if the message is not completely
stored in memory:

sm3_nit() initializes a B<sm3_ctx_t> structure.

sm3_update() can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message to
be hashed (B<len> bytes at B<data>).

sm3_final() places the message digest in B<md>, which must have space
for SM3_DIGEST_LENGTH == 32 bytes of output, and erases the B<sm3_ctx_t>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

sm3_init(), sm3_update(), sm3_final(), sm3_compress() and sm3() return void.
