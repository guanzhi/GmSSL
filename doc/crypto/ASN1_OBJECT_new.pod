=head1 NAME

ASN1_OBJECT_new, ASN1_OBJECT_free - object allocation functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/asn1.h>

 ASN1_OBJECT *ASN1_OBJECT_new(void);
 void ASN1_OBJECT_free(ASN1_OBJECT *a);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ASN1_OBJECT allocation routines, allocate and free an
ASN1_OBJECT structure, which represents an ASN1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates and initializes an ASN1_OBJECT structure.

ASN1_OBJECT_free() frees up the B<ASN1_OBJECT> structure B<a>.
If B<a> is NULL, nothing is done.

=head1 NOTES

Although ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates a new ASN1_OBJECT structure it
is almost never used in applications. The ASN1 object utility functions
such as OBJ_nid2obj() are used instead.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, ASN1_OBJECT_new() returns B<NULL> and sets an error
code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

ASN1_OBJECT_free() returns no value.
