=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 int X509_digest(const X509 *data, const EVP_MD *type, unsigned char *md,
                 unsigned int *len);

 int X509_CRL_digest(const X509_CRL *data, const EVP_MD *type, unsigned char *md,
                 unsigned int *len);

 int X509_pubkey_digest(const X509 *data, const EVP_MD *type,
                        unsigned char *md, unsigned int *len);

                     unsigned char *md, unsigned int *len);

 int X509_NAME_digest(const X509_NAME *data, const EVP_MD *type,
                      unsigned char *md, unsigned int *len);

 int PKCS7_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL_digest(PKCS7_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL *data,
                                    const EVP_MD *type, unsigned char *md,
                                    unsigned int *len);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_pubkey_digest() returns a digest of the DER representation of the public
key in the specified X509 B<data> object.
All other functions described here return a digest of the DER representation
of their entire B<data> objects.

The B<type> parameter specifies the digest to
be used, such as EVP_sha1(). The B<md> is a pointer to the buffer where the
digest will be copied and is assumed to be large enough; the constant
B<EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE> is suggested. The B<len> parameter, if not NULL, points
to a place where the digest size will be stored.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

All functions described here return 1 for success and 0 for failure.
