=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version, SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version,
SSL_set_min_proto_version, SSL_set_max_proto_version - Set minimum
and maximum supported protocol version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(SSL_CTX *ctx, int version);
 int SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version(SSL_CTX *ctx, int version);
 int SSL_set_min_proto_version(SSL *ssl, int version);
 int SSL_set_max_proto_version(SSL *ssl, int version);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functions set the minimum and maximum supported protocol versions
for the B<ctx> or B<ssl>.
This works in combination with the options set via
L<SSL_CTX_set_options(3)> that also make it possible to disable
specific protocol versions.
Use these functions instead of disabling specific protocol versions.

Setting the minimum or maximum version to 0, will enable protocol
versions down to the lowest version, or up to the highest version
supported by the library, respectively.

Currently supported versions are B<SSL3_VERSION>, B<TLS1_VERSION>,
B<TLS1_1_VERSION>, B<TLS1_2_VERSION> for TLS and B<DTLS1_VERSION>,
B<DTLS1_2_VERSION> for DTLS.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

=head1 NOTES

All these functions are implemented using macros.

=head1 HISTORY

The functions were added in OpenSSL 1.1.0
