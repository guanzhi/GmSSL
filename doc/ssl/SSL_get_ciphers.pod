=head1 NAME

SSL_get1_supported_ciphers, SSL_get_client_ciphers,
SSL_get_ciphers, SSL_CTX_get_ciphers, SSL_get_cipher_list
- get list of available SSL_CIPHERs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) *SSL_get_ciphers(const SSL *ssl);
 STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) *SSL_CTX_get_ciphers(const SSL_CTX *ctx);
 STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) *SSL_get1_supported_ciphers(SSL *s);
 STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) *SSL_get_client_ciphers(const SSL *ssl);
 const char *SSL_get_cipher_list(const SSL *ssl, int priority);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get_ciphers() returns the stack of available SSL_CIPHERs for B<ssl>,
sorted by preference. If B<ssl> is NULL or no ciphers are available, NULL
is returned.

SSL_CTX_get_ciphers() returns the stack of available SSL_CIPHERs for B<ctx>.

SSL_get1_supported_ciphers() returns the stack of enabled SSL_CIPHERs for
B<ssl>, sorted by preference.
The list depends on settings like the cipher list, the supported protocol
versions, the security level, and the enabled signature algorithms.
SRP and PSK ciphers are only enabled if the appropriate callbacks or settings
have been applied.
This is the list that will be sent by the client to the server.
The list supported by the server might include more ciphers in case there is a
hole in the list of supported protocols.
The server will also not use ciphers from this list depending on the
configured certificates and DH parameters.
If B<ssl> is NULL or no ciphers are available, NULL is returned.

SSL_get_client_ciphers() returns the stack of available SSL_CIPHERs matching the
list received from the client on B<ssl>. If B<ssl> is NULL, no ciphers are
available, or B<ssl> is not operating in server mode, NULL is returned.

SSL_get_cipher_list() returns a pointer to the name of the SSL_CIPHER
listed for B<ssl> with B<priority>. If B<ssl> is NULL, no ciphers are
available, or there are less ciphers than B<priority> available, NULL
is returned.

=head1 NOTES

The details of the ciphers obtained by SSL_get_ciphers(), SSL_CTX_get_ciphers()
SSL_get1_supported_ciphers() and SSL_get_client_ciphers() can be obtained using
the L<SSL_CIPHER_get_name(3)> family of functions.

Call SSL_get_cipher_list() with B<priority> starting from 0 to obtain the
sorted list of available ciphers, until NULL is returned.

Note: SSL_get_ciphers(), SSL_CTX_get_ciphers() and SSL_get_client_ciphers()
return a pointer to an internal cipher stack, which will be freed later on when
the SSL or SSL_SESSION object is freed.  Therefore, the calling code B<MUST NOT>
free the return value itself.

The stack returned by SSL_get1_supported_ciphers() should be freed using
sk_SSL_CIPHER_free().
