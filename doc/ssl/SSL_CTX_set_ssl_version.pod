=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version, SSL_set_ssl_method, SSL_get_ssl_method
- choose a new TLS/SSL method

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version(SSL_CTX *ctx, const SSL_METHOD *method);
 int SSL_set_ssl_method(SSL *s, const SSL_METHOD *method);
 const SSL_METHOD *SSL_get_ssl_method(SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version() sets a new default TLS/SSL B<method> for SSL objects
newly created from this B<ctx>. SSL objects already created with
L<SSL_new(3)> are not affected, except when
L<SSL_clear(3)> is being called.

SSL_set_ssl_method() sets a new TLS/SSL B<method> for a particular B<ssl>
object. It may be reset, when SSL_clear() is called.

SSL_get_ssl_method() returns a function pointer to the TLS/SSL method
set in B<ssl>.

=head1 NOTES

The available B<method> choices are described in
L<SSL_CTX_new(3)>.

When L<SSL_clear(3)> is called and no session is connected to
an SSL object, the method of the SSL object is reset to the method currently
set in the corresponding SSL_CTX object.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur for SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version()
and SSL_set_ssl_method():

=over 4

=item Z<>0
