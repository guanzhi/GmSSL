=head1 NAME

gendsa - generate a DSA private key from a set of parameters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[B<-aes128>]
[B<-aes192>]
[B<-aes256>]
[B<-camellia128>]

[B<-camellia256>]
[B<-des>]
[B<-des3>]
[B<-idea>]
[B<-rand file(s)>]
[B<-engine id>]
[B<paramfile>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<gendsa> command generates a DSA private key from a DSA parameter file
(which will be typically generated by the B<gmssl dsaparam> command).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-out filename>

Output the key to the specified file. If this argument is not specified then
standard output is used.

=item B<-aes128|-aes192|-aes256|-camellia128|-camellia192|-camellia256|-des|-des3|-idea>

These options encrypt the private key with specified
cipher before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.
If none of these options is specified no encryption is used.

=item B<-rand file(s)>

a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator, or an EGD socket (see L<RAND_egd(3)>).
Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character.
The separator is B<;> for MS-Windows, B<,> for OpenVMS, and B<:> for
all others.

=item B<-engine id>

specifying an engine (by its unique B<id> string) will cause B<gendsa>
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.

=item B<paramfile>

This option specifies the DSA parameter file to use. The parameters in this
file determine the size of the private key. DSA parameters can be generated
and examined using the B<gmssl dsaparam> command.

=head1 NOTES

DSA key generation is little more than random number generation so it is
much quicker that RSA key generation for example.
