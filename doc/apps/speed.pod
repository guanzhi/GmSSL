=head1 NAME

speed - test library performance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gmssl speed>
[B<-help>]
[B<-engine id>]
[B<-elapsed>]
[B<-evp algo>]
[B<-decrypt>]
[B<algorithm...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to test the performance of cryptographic algorithms.
To see the list of supported algorithms, use the I<list --digest-commands>
or I<list --cipher-commands> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-engine id>

specifying an engine (by its unique B<id> string) will cause B<speed>
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.

=item B<-elapsed>

Measure time in real time instead of CPU time. It can be useful when testing
speed of hardware engines.

=item B<-evp algo>

Use the specified cipher or message digest algorithm via the EVP interface.

=item B<-decrypt>

Time the decryption instead of encryption. Affects only the EVP testing.

=item B<[zero or more test algorithms]>

If any options are given, B<speed> tests those algorithms, otherwise all of
the above are tested.
