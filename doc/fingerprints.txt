Fingerprints for Signing Releases

OpenSSL releases are signed with PGP/GnuPG keys.  This file contains
the fingerprints of team members who are "authorized" to sign the
next release.

The signature is a detached cleartxt signature, with the same name
as the release but with ".asc" appended.  For example, release
1.0.1h can be found in openssl-1.0.1h.tar.gz with the signature
in the file named openssl-1.0.1h.tar.gz.asc.

The following is the list of fingerprints for the keys that are
currently in use to sign OpenSSL distributions:
