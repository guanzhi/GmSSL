# Note: Unlike the TLS tests, we will never do resumption with server
# initiated reneg. This is because an OpenSSL DTLS client will always do a full
# handshake (i.e. it doesn't supply a session id) when it receives a
# HelloRequest. This is different to the OpenSSL TLS implementation where an
# OpenSSL client will always try an abbreviated handshake (i.e. it will supply
# the session id). This goes all the way to commit 48ae85b6f when abbreviated
# handshake support was first added. Neither behaviour is wrong, but the
# discrepancy is strange. TODO: Should we harmonise the TLS and DTLS behaviour,
# and if so, what to?
