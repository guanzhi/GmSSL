liboqs
======

liboqs is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

Overview
--------

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs initially focuses on key exchange algorithms.  liboqs provides a common API suitable for post-quantum key exchange algorithms, and will collect together various implementations.  liboqs will also include a test harness and benchmarking routines to compare performance of post-quantum implementations.

OQS will also include integrations into application-level protocols to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  Our first integration is in OpenSSL:

- **open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into OpenSSL 1.0.2.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered "production quality".  See more about this integration in its GitHub repository [open-quantum-safe/openssl/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/).

More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).

Building and Running on Linux and macOS
---------------------------------------

Builds have been tested on Mac OS X 10.11.6, macOS 10.12.5, Ubuntu 16.04.1.

### Install dependencies for macOS

You need to install `autoconf`, `automake` and `libtool`:

	brew install autoconf automake libtool

### Install dependencies for Ubuntu

You need to install autoconf, automake and libtool:

	sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool

### Building

To build, first clone or download the source from GitHub, then simply type:

	autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make clean
	make

This will generate:

- `liboqs.a`: A static library with implementations for the algorithms listed in "Contents" above.
- `test_rand`: A simple test harness for the random number generator.  This will test the distance of PRNG output from uniform using statistical distance.
- `test_aes`: A simple test harness for AES.  This will test the correctness of the C implementation (and of the AES-NI implementation, if not disabled) of AES, and will compare the speed of these implementations against OpenSSL's AES implementation.
- `test_kex`: A simple test harness for the default key exchange algorithm.  This will output key exchange messages; indicate whether the parties agree on the session key or not over a large number of trials; and measure the distance of the sessions keys from uniform using statistical distance.
- `test_sig`: A simple test harness for the signature algorithms.

### Running

To run the tests, simply type:

	make test

To run benchmarks, run

	./test_kex --bench

To run benchmark only on some ciphers, run

	./test_kex --help

to list the available ciphers and then run e.g.

	./test_kex --bench rlwe_bcns15 rlwe_newhope


#### Memory benchmarks

To run one or more ciphers only once use `--mem-bench`, which is suitable for memory usage profiling:

	./test_kex --mem-bench ntru

You may also get instant memory usage results of an algorithm (e.g. ntru) by running [valgrind's massif tool](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html) by running

	./kex_bench_memory.sh ntru


### Additional build options

#### Building with OpenSSL algorithms enabled:

OpenSSL can be used for some symmetric crypto algorithms, which may result in better performance.

To build with OpenSSL enabled:

	./configure --enable-openssl
	make clean
	make

You may need to specify the path to your OpenSSL directory:

	./configure --enable-openssl --with-openssl-dir=/path/to/openssl/directory
	make clean
	make

### Building with `kex_sidh_iqc_ref` enabled

The `kex_sidh_iqc_ref ` key exchange method is not enabled by default since it requires an external library (libgmp).

To install the library on macOS:

	brew install gmp

To build with `kex_sidh_iqc_ref ` enabled:

	./configure --enable-sidhiqc
	make clean
	make

You may need to specify the path to your libgmp directory:

	./configure --enable-sidhiqc --with-gmp-dir=/path/to/gmp/directory
	make clean
	make

### Building with `kex_code_mcbits` enabled

The `kex_code_mcbits` key exchange method is not enabled by default since it requires an external library (libsodium).

To install the library on macOS:

	brew install libsodium

To install the library on Ubuntu:

	sudo apt install libsodium-dev

To build with `kex_code_mcbits ` enabled:

	./configure --enable-mcbits
	make clean
	make

### Building with the following KEX algorithms disabled

  ./configure --disable-kex-ntru --disable-kex-lwe-frodo --disable-kex-mlwe-kyber --disable-kex-rlwe-msrln16  --disable-kex-rlwe-newhope --disable-kex-sidh-cln16
  make clean
  make

### Building with `sig_picnic` enabled

The `sig_picnic` signature algorithm is not enabled by default since it requires:

- external libraries (`openssl` and `m4ri`);
- to download and setup Picnic;
- a parameters generation preprocessing step.

To install the libraries on macOS:

	brew install openssl homebrew/science/m4ri

To install the libraries on Ubuntu:

	sudo apt install libssl-dev libm4ri-dev

To download the Picnic source code:

	./download-and-setup-picnic.sh

To build with `sig_picnic` enabled:

	./configure --enable-picnic --enable-openssl [--with-openssl-dir=<..> --with-m4r-dir=<..>]
	make clean
	make
	make test   (this generates data needed by the Picnic library)

Building and running on Windows
-------------------------------

Windows binaries can be generated using the Visual Studio solution in the VisualStudio folder.  Builds have been tested on Windows 10.

McBits is disabled by default in the Visual Studio build; follow these steps to enable it:

- Obtain the [libsodium library](https://libsodium.org); compile the static library from the Visual Studio projects.
- Add `ENABLE_CODE_MCBITS` and `SODIUM_STATIC` to the preprocessor definitions of the `oqs` and `test_kex` projects.
- Add the sodium "src/include" location to the "Additional Include Directories" in the oqs project C properties.
- Add the libsodium library to the "Additional Dependencies" in the `test_kex` project Linker properties.

Building for Android
--------------------

Install Android NDK

Create a standalone toolchain for the platform that you wish to cross compile for (e.g. NDK_BUNDLE="~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle" ARCH=arm64 INSTALL_DIR="/tmp/ndk-toolchain"):

	$NDK_BUNDLE/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --arch $ARCH --install-dir $INSTALL_DIR

Configure and build for Android after running `autoreconf -i` (e.g. HOST=aarch64-linux-android TOOLCHAIN_DIR=$INSTALL_DIR):

	./configure-android --host=$HOST --toolchain=$TOOLCHAIN_DIR
	make

Run it from your Android device:

	adb push test_kex  /data/local/tmp/
	adb shell "/data/local/tmp/test_kex"

Tested on SM-930F


Documentation
-------------

The directory `docs/Algorithm data sheets` contains information about some of the algorithms supported by liboqs.

### Doxygen documentation

Some source files contain inline Doxygen-formatted comments which can be used to generate additional documentation.

On macOS, you may need to install several dependencies first:

	brew install doxygen graphviz

The documentation can be generated by running:

	make docs

This will generate the `docs/doxygen/html` directory.  Check `./configure --help` for generating other formats.

Contributing and using
----------------------

We hope OQS will provide a framework for many post-quantum implementations.

In the immediate term, if you have feedback on our API ([kex.h](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/src/kex/kex.h), [sig.h](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/src/sig/sig.h) or [rand.h](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/src/rand/rand.h)), please contact us so we can ensure our API covers a wide range of implementation needs.

If you have or are writing an implementation of a post-quantum key exchange algorithm, we hope you will consider making an implementation that meets our API so that others may use it and would be happy to discuss including it directly in liboqs.  Please take a look at our [coding conventions](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Coding-conventions).

If you would like to use liboqs in an application-level protocol, please get in touch and we can provide some guidance on options for using liboqs.

We are also interested in assistance from code reviewers.

Please contact Douglas Stebila <[stebilad@mcmaster.ca](mailto:stebilad@mcmaster.ca)>.
