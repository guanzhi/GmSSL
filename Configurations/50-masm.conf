# We can't make commitment to supporting Microsoft assembler,
# because it would mean supporting all masm versions. This in
# in turn is because masm is not really an interchangeable option,
# while users tend to have reasons to stick with specific Visual
# Studio versions. It's usually lesser hassle to make it work
# with latest assembler, but tweaking for older versions had
# proven to be daunting task. This is experimental target, for
# production builds stick with [up-to-date version of] nasm.
